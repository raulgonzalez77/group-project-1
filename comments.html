<!-- INTRO: (Kirsten) This is a file where we can further document what we are doing and planning to do via comments. 
Comments inline on actual site-building files is strongly recommended. Please make sure to use enter line breaks so that this file is 
easily readable! Please keep comments between these tags as shown, and putting your name around snippets like I'm doing here is a good idea. 
Of course, this is just a guideline. (Kirsten) END INTRO

CONFLICT RESOLUTION: If anyone's code or ideas conflict, please talk it out in the forum or Groupme and come to an agreement before deleting 
anything. Debugging as we go saves a lot of headache later.

(Kirsten) PLANNING 01: 
index.html (homepage)
form.html (form)
location pages 
images (tbd, will handle- Kirsten)
global.css (css for whole site, ie background colors)
comments.html (you are here!)
README.MD (readme)

Once I get the skeletons of each page up in the repo everyone should be able to add to it in real time cooperatively.
Everyone can work on any task as they wish, this is for organizational purposes.
